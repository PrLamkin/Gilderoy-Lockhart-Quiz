Creators note: By the time I had gotten to creating a score and time system as I had wanted I realized that I would not be able to implement it with the code I had created in JS. Time alloted for this quiz would not have worked, I would've had to start from scratcg. Things to note for my future reference, line-up my code to start with and make a reference of how my code should be brought up. Go from top to bottom working on the code, from what needs to be specified first to the very last. This Product is a failure, but it's a learning moment for me.
